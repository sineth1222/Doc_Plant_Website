                            Bacterial spot is a serious disease affecting tomatoes and peppers, caused by different species of Xanthomonas bacteria (X. vesicatoria, X. euvesicatoria, X. perforans, and X. gardneri). It can lead to significant yield losses in warm, humid conditions. Bacterial spot can be a devastating disease when the weather is warm and humid.
                            Four closely related bacteria cause bacterial spot: Xanthomonas vesicatoria, X. euvesicatoria, X. gardneri, and X. perforans.
                            The disease can affect all above-ground parts of tomato and pepper plants: stems, petioles, leaves, and fruits.
                            Fruit spots commonly result in unmarketable fruit.

                          Tomato plant leaves will develop small spots that are brown with a yellow ring around them. These spots often fall away and leave holes behind. Fruits may have scabby spots as well. When it first appears on the leaves, bacterial spot is similar in appearance to many other tomatoes diseases
                          Tomato leaves have small (less than 1/8 inch), brown, circular spots surrounded by a yellow halo.
                          The center of the leaf spots often falls out resulting in small holes.
                          The leaf spots do not contain concentric rings, spots with concentric rings are likely caused by early blight.
                          Pepper leaves have small (less than 1/8 inch), brown, circular spots that do not have a yellow halo and centers do not fall out.
                          Small, brown, circular spots may also occur on stems and the fruit calyx.
                          Fruit spots are 1/4 inch, slightly raised, brown and scabby.
                          Tomato fruit often have a waxy white halo surrounding the fruit spot.
                          Pepper fruit spots often occur on the stem-end of the fruit.
                          Spots occur on green and red fruit but do not result in rot.

                          Bacterial spot is a disease that effects tomatoes and peppers in particularly hot, humid conditions. Multiple bacteria are known to cause this disease, which results in spotty, pitted fruits. Four closely related bacteria cause bacterial spot: Xanthomonas vesicatoria, X. euvesicatoria, X. gardneri, and X. perforans.
                          Different strains infect either tomato or pepper or both.
                          All strains prefer high temperatures (75°F to 86°F), high humidity, and frequent rainfall/overhead irrigation.
                          Bacteria survive on plant debris in the soil for one to two years, but will not survive once plant debris breaks down.
                          Introduction is primarily on infected seed or infected transplants. Even seedlings that do not show symptoms may be infected and will show symptoms later in the growing season.
                          Bacteria can spread from plant to plant by tools, growers’ hands, or through splashing rain or irrigation water.
                          Between rotations, the bacteria may survive on tomato or pepper volunteer plants.

                          Bacterial spot of tomato and pepper. University of Minnesota Extension.
                          Remove infected plants and rotate crops. Choose resistant varieties, water in the morning so that excess water has time to dry, space out plants properly.
                          Look for leaves with spots, especially during periods of wet, humid weather.
                          Remove leaves with symptoms. There are many varieties of bell pepper and hot pepper with resistance to bacterial spot.
                          A few tomato varieties with resistance are available. Plant tomatoes where no tomatoes, potatoes, peppers or eggplants have been for the past 3-4 years.
                          If starting your own seeds, choose seeds from a reputable supplier.
                          If saving seeds, use a hot water treatment.
                          If buying transplants, inspect transplants and choose plants without spots or discoloration
                          Keep tomato leaves as dry as possible. Water with drip irrigation or a soaker hose. If watering by hand, do so at the base of the plant.
                          Water in the morning so leaves dry quickly in the sun.
                          Space plants so that air flows between them.  This could range from 18-24 inches for caged tomatoes to 30-36 inches for uncaged determinate tomatoes.
                          Stake or cage plants.
                          Remove or bury plants at the end of the season.
